Known bugs
----------
* When loading a vector file from disk, it is the exclusive responsability of 
the user to make sure that the file being loaded was saved using the same 
input parameters as the current run. I am refering to distCharges, because 
fieldStrength is ignored in that case..
 - adding a small header to the output files may solve the problem
