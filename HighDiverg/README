Detecting high divergence points.
---------------------------------

HighDiverg - returns points where the divergence of the vector field is above
   a certain threshold (computed as a percentage of the maximum divergence 
   value over the entire field).

localMaxDiv - finds the points where the divergence of the vector field is a
   local maximum (compared to it's 26 neighbors (neighbors where force = 0 are
   ignored)).
