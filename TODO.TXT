TO DO list:
~~~~~~~~~~~
* pfSkel
   - pad volume with 2 layers always and then check that every segment is inside the original volume. If not, remove the segment. Another solution: reconect the skeleton if disconnected (to closest piece ?)
 

* all - make sure all fopen is using b when necessary
      - do not use argv[] in the code to reference parameters - use other pointers initialized right at the begining of main instead.
      - print program parameters at the begining
      - spell check all files
      - remove exit from all functions - return false and always CHECK the return value before continuing

* common  - ReadVectorField() allocate the array inside the function
            ComputerPotentialField() allocate the field array inside the function
* potField: - use the flags when taking boundary points.
            - no upper bound on the boundary array
            - no more sorting
            - half of boundary points as parameter

*Debug options group:
  - output field file, critical points, high div points, hich curvature points, ....

* New optional parameters: 
    - all #defines from the files         
    
* User and programmer manual
